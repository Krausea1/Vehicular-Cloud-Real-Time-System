# Vehicular-Cloud-Real-Time-System

Motivated by the success of conventional cloud computing, vehicular clouds were introduced as a group of vehicles whose corporate computing, sensing, communication and physical resources can be coordinated and dynamically allocated to authorized users.Vehicular  Cloud  Real  Time  System  (VCRTS)  is  a  system  for  managing  and  organizing computation resources and jobs in vehicular cloud. VCRTS also includes a visual representation of information that indicates progress or status of a process. 
The objectives of VCRTS project are to:
1. Provide  a  system  for  using  computation  services  in  Vehicular  Cloud  (VC),  including registering  new  vehicles  and  adding  them  to  the  computation  resource  pool,  submitting jobs and keeping track of progress and completion time of the jobs in real-time report.
2. Visualize the real-time report.
